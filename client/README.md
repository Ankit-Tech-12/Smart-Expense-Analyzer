# 💰 Smart Expense Analyzer

Smart Expense Analyzer is a **React + Redux Toolkit** based expense tracking and analytics application that helps users **record, analyze, and visualize their spending patterns** with real-time insights.

This project focuses on **clean state management, derived analytics, and scalable frontend architecture**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ➕ Add and remove expenses with amount, category, date, and notes
- 📊 Total expense calculation using memoized selectors
- 🧩 Category-wise expense aggregation
- 📅 Monthly comparison (current month vs previous month)
- 🚨 Spending spike detection for unusual increases
- 💾 Persistent data using `localStorage`
- 📈 Visual analytics using Pie and Bar charts
- 🎯 Controlled category selection to avoid data inconsistency
- 📱 Fully responsive dashboard layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop

---

## 🧠 Architecture & Design

- Redux stores **only raw data** (expenses and categories)
- All analytics are implemented as **derived state**
- Uses `createSelector` for **memoization and performance**
- Clear separation of concerns:
  - UI components
  - Redux slices
  - Selectors (analytics layer)
- Reducers remain **pure** with no side effects

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit, React-Redux
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Charts:** Recharts
- **Persistence:** localStorage

## 📊 Analytics Overview

- **Total Expenses:** Sum of all expense amounts
- **Category Totals:** Aggregated using `reduce`
- **Monthly Comparison:** Current vs previous month spending
- **Spending Spike Detection:** Alerts when spending increases by ≥25%

All analytics are implemented using **memoized Redux selectors**, not stored state.
