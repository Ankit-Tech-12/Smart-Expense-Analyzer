Smart Expense Analyzer – React & Redux Analytics Dashboard

📌 Resume Bullets (Best Version)
⭐ Short & Powerful (1–2 bullets)

Use this if resume space is tight:

Built a Smart Expense Analyzer using React and Redux Toolkit, implementing global state management, derived analytics via memoized selectors, and persistent storage with localStorage.

Designed category-wise, monthly comparison, and spending spike analytics without storing redundant state, following clean Redux architecture principles.

⭐⭐ Standard Version (Most Recommended)

Developed a Smart Expense Analyzer using React, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS, enabling users to track, categorize, and analyze expenses in real time.

Implemented memoized selectors (createSelector) to compute derived data such as total expenses, category-wise totals, monthly comparisons, and spending spike detection.

Designed a rule-based spending spike alert system to detect unusual increases in expenses compared to previous months.

Persisted application state using localStorage hydration and store subscriptions, ensuring data survives page refreshes without side effects in reducers.

Visualized analytics using Recharts (Pie & Bar charts) for clear and intuitive financial insights.

⭐⭐⭐ Advanced / FAANG-style Version (Use if confident)

Architected a Smart Expense Analyzer using React and Redux Toolkit, applying separation of concerns by storing only raw data in Redux and computing analytics via memoized selectors.

Built reusable selectors for category aggregation, monthly expense comparison, and anomaly detection, ensuring efficient recalculation only when underlying state changes.

Implemented persistent Redux state using preloaded state and store subscriptions, maintaining purity of reducers and improving application reliability.

Designed a scalable category management system backed by Redux to prevent data inconsistency caused by user input errors.

Integrated data visualization using Recharts, transforming derived Redux state into responsive Pie and Bar charts.

🧠 One-Line Interview Explanation (VERY IMPORTANT)

Memorize this 👇

“I built a Smart Expense Analyzer using React and Redux Toolkit where Redux stores only raw expense data, and all analytics like totals, category breakdowns, monthly comparisons, and spike detection are computed using memoized selectors for performance and scalability.”

That line alone can carry a 5–7 minute interview discussion.
